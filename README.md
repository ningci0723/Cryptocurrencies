# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the investment.
This classification report might be used by an investment bank to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients.
We use the following methods for the analysis:

* Part 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Part 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Part 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Part 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results



## Results
